# Steel-tension-member-failure-mode-probabity-prediction
using techniques of machine learning developing a smart algorithm to predict the failure mode in steel members with sectional area parameters
the data set was prepared from research papers found on google scholar, it consisted of 4 steel sections single angle, double angle, W and T sections with block shear and net section failure mode
